"content":"You are looking at a screenshot of a programming problem statement and examples. The problem is about writing a function that takes a sorted array as input and creates a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) using the elements of the array. There are two examples given that show the input arrays and the structure of the expected Balanced BSTs.
Key Points from Image:

- The task is to write a function to create a Balanced BST from a sorted array.
- There are examples provided to illustrate the expected output.
- The problem was last updated on April 5, 2023.
- An explanation is provided for how the elements are arranged in the BST relative to the root.

If you need to create such a function, you would typically use a recursive algorithm to ensure that the resulting tree is balanced by picking the middle element of the array for the root of the BST and then doing the same for each subsequent sub-array.

 'You are looking at a screenshot of a webpage that provides coding instructions for creating a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) from a given sorted array. The screenshot includes a description of the problem followed by two examples illustrating the input arrays and the structure of the corresponding output BSTs.\n\nHere are the points displayed in the image:\n\n1. The task: Write a function that uses elements from a sorted array to create a Balanced Binary Search Tree.\n2. Two examples are provided:\n   - First Example:\n     - Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}\n     - Output: A Balanced BST visualized as:\n         2\n        / 
        1   3\n     - Explanation: Elements less than 2 are on the left, elements greater than 2 are on the right.\n   - Second Example:\n     - Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n     - Output: A Balanced BST visualized as:\n         3\n        /

first geeksforgeeks response:
"You are looking at a screenshot that appears to be from a website providing computer science learning material. Specifically, it describes a problem statement about creating a balanced binary search tree (BST) from a given sorted array. There are examples provided which show the input arrays and the corresponding structure of the balanced BSTs created from those arrays.\n\nIn the first example, the input array is [1, 2, 3], and the output is a balanced BST with '2' as the root node, '1' as the left child, and '3' as the right child.\n\nThe second example shows an input array [1, 2, 3, 4] and the output is a balanced BST where '3' is the root node, '2' is the left child of '3', '4' is the right child of '3', and '1' is the left child of '2'. \n\nThe explanation provided for the first example clarifies that all elements less than 2 are on the left side and all the elements greater than 2 are on the right side, adhering to the properties of a binary search tree."
